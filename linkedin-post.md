🔧 **Technical Deep Dive: Building an ATS-Optimized Resume Builder**

I recently completed a comprehensive AI Resume Builder focused on solving the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) challenge that many professionals face. Here are the technical highlights:

## 🏗️ Architecture:
- **State Management**: Zustand with date validation and sorting
- **Date Parsing**: Custom system supporting 15+ international formats
- **ATS Templates**: 3 professional layouts with 95-100% ATS scores
- **AI Integration**: Contextual summary generation for 40+ career paths

## 📅 Advanced Date System:
- Input normalization and cleaning
- Real calendar validation (no impossible dates)
- Present/current term variations (12+ variations)
- International format support (DD-MM-YYYY, MM-YYYY, etc.)
- Performance caching for large datasets

## 🎯 ATS Optimization:
- Standard section headings (PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY, WORK EXPERIENCE, etc.)
- Font and layout compliance (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Real-time scoring with actionable recommendations
- Structured error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🚀 Performance Features:
- LRU caching for date parsing (1000 entries)

- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## 💡 Key Learnings:
